# Inspiration
This was heavily inpired by [Mary Rose Cook's video where she live-coded space invaders in 30 minutes](https://vimeo.com/105955605).

I decided to try to emulate the game using functional programming principles rather than OO programming as she did. This is the result.

# To Run
`git clone` the repository
`npm start`
